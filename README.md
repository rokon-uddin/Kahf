# Kahf Browser

This project is a Swift-based secure browser built using the `App Proxy Network Extension` for enhanced privacy and security. The browser intercepts and manages network traffic securely, allowing users to browse the web through a VPN-enabled connection.

## Features

- **Web Browsing**: Browse websites using the integrated `SwiftUIWebView` component.
- **Privacy Control**: Users can adjust the privacy level via an in-app picker, toggling between predefined settings.
- **VPN Toggle**: Enable or disable a VPN connection directly from the browser interface.
- **Navigation**: Standard browser navigation with forward and backward buttons.
- **App Proxy Integration**: 
  - Intercepts network traffic using the `App Proxy Network Extension` and forwards data securely.
  - Logs TCP and UDP traffic, allowing inspection and optional modification of network packets.
  - Supports monitoring of network requests to ensure secure communication.

## Code Overview

- **SecureBrowserView.swift**: The main UI of the browser, including navigation and URL input.
- **SwiftUIWebView.swift**: A wrapper around a `WKWebView`, integrated with SwiftUI.
- **SecureBrowserViewModel.swift**: The view model that handles browser logic, such as loading URLs and managing VPN state.
- **ProxyManager.swift**: Manages VPN settings and controls network traffic.
- **AppProxyProvider.swift**: Handles the interception of TCP and UDP traffic using the Network Extension framework.
- **Constants.swift & PrivacyLevel.swift**: Define configuration constants and privacy levels available for the browser.

## How It Works

1. **VPN Activation**: Users can toggle the VPN setting, which is managed by the `ProxyManager` class. It uses `App Proxy Network Extension` to securely route traffic.
2. **Traffic Interception**: The `AppProxyProvider` captures and optionally modifies network traffic, ensuring that the browser communicates securely with remote servers.
3. **WebView Interface**: The `SwiftUIWebView` provides a simple interface for browsing, while `SecureBrowserViewModel` controls the flow of data and interactions.

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.8+

## Installation

To test the project, clone the repository and open it in Xcode. Please note that Network Extension functionality is not supported in the simulator, so youâ€™ll need to build and run the app on a physical device. Additionally, the provider extensions require code signing with the appropriate entitlements, meaning you must be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program to test the app properly.
